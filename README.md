# HW1--Basic Portfolio

## Overview

This was an assignment that utilized html and css to structure and stylize a web page. The main learning objectives were understanding html structure through elements such as header, div, and footer, along with attributes such as class and id. Layout concepts were explored using floats and positioning allowing me to understand the dynamics of nesting elements within eachother. 

I also gained more experience in making making folders and files through the command line, as well as pushing changes into github.
